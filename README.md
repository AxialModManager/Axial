## FAQ

When it's finished.

Not currently. However, there are plans for Quest support in the future. Initially done remotely from PC and eventually in the headset itself.

**Can people make PRs/contribute to this?**<br>
Certainly. However, since this is early development: it would probably be best to get in contact with me first.
